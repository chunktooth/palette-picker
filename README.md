# Palette Picker 
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chunktooth/palette-picker.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chunktooth/palette-picker)

By [chunktooth](https://github.com/chunktooth/)

Hosted on Heroku http://palette-picker-vintage.herokuapp.com/

Inspired by Coolers, warning: this vintage colored TV will generate random color palette for you (at your own risk & leisure!) Users can lock the color even while being randomized, every palette can be saved to or deleted from a project of your choice.

# Specs
First time building server with Knex.js/Express.js with TRAVIS CI for quality production. Written in jQuery for good measures. Responsiveness coming soon!
